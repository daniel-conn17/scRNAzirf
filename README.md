## scRNAzirf

scRNAzirf is an implementation of the zero-inflated random forests ZIRFs
algorithm. ZIRFs is an extension of random forests designed to explicitly
account for the high rates of zero-inflation found in certain types of
single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. This package serves as

## Installation

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
